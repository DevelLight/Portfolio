            Hello, I'm Marcel Hurban. With this blog I want to introduce you to my new website and my current Linux-NixOS-Config. Let's start with the topic ‘Website Design’. When I looked at my portfolio again a few days ago, I discovered a fat white bar on my rather dark website. Not only did my eyes hurt, but the design of the site was also destroyed. Knowing that the previous website didn't contain enough information and wasn't easy to use, I decided to redesign it. As I spend my free time working on productivity and digital minimalism, I immediately found a ‘minimalism’ design approach. The most important information about me is on the main page and the unimportant information is on extra pages. I got this idea from a book I'm currently reading, because the essential things should be prioritised and the rather unessential ‘distractions’ minimised. To access this unimportant information, there is an arrow on the left-hand side of the website. This opens a side menu with links: New, Blogs, Art and Hardware. These pages also have a minimalist design and are intended to show the most important things at a glance. The eyes should also not be destroyed by a bright colour, so I stuck with a dark style. In conclusion, I can say that I am very happy with my work and that I don't even use Javascript for the website.
